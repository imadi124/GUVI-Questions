# OOPs Features & Interface

# Problem Statement:
Create an interface Shape with methods area and perimeter. Implement this interface in two classes: Rectangle and Circle. Each class should have appropriate constructors and methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

# Description:
Define an interface Shape with methods double area() and double perimeter().

Create a class Rectangle that implements Shape with properties length and width.
Create a class Circle that implements Shape with property radius.
Ensure the Rectangle and Circle classes have constructors to initialize their properties.
Implement the methods area and perimeter in both classes.
# Input Format:
String representing the shape type (Rectangle or Circle).
If Rectangle, two doubles representing length and width.
If Circle, one double representing radius.
# Output Format:
Double representing the area of the shape.
Double representing the perimeter of the shape.

# Sample Input:
Rectangle
5
10
# Sample Output:
Area: 50.0
Perimeter: 30.0
