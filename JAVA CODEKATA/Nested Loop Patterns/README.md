# Nested Loop Patterns

# Problem Statement:
Write a program that generates a pattern based on user input using nested loops. The pattern to be generated is a pyramid where each level contains a specific number of symbols. Each level's pattern should follow a unique rule:

The number of symbols on each level is equal to the level number.
The symbol for each level is based on the level number where odd levels use * and even levels use #.
# Description:
You need to implement a Java program that:

Takes an integer 
N (number of levels) as input.
Generates and prints the pyramid pattern according to the rules described.
# Input Format:
Single line: Integer 
N (Number of levels)
# Output Format:
Pyramid pattern with 
N levels, where odd levels use * and even levels use #.
